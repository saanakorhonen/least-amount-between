# Least amount between

Program demonstrates counting for least amount of numbers fitting between two integers. For example, given an array of [1, 5, 10], answer would be 3, as 2, 3, 4 fit between 1 and 5. 

If array cannot be counted (having under two elements or having only the same elements), an error signal of -1 is returned.
